# UILib
A feature-rich UI library for [Peaks of Yore](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2236070/).

This library uses an [older Unity UI library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/index.html)
and Unity's [legacy input system](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.html) underneath,
but it tries to simplify the process of programmatically building UIs.

This is intended to be used by mod developers to greatly assist in the
process of building intuitive and customisable interfaces which blend
nicely into Peaks of Yore's style (unless you want something else, in which case
there are ways to do that as well).

There are overlays, windows, window management, a variety of components,
notifications, themes, simple layout systems, and more.

Here are some useful links to get started:
